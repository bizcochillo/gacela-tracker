# gacela-tracker (sharks-tracker?) 
A tiny Xamarin project Chrono for tracking new champions. 

Basic idea: Track the time over a defined amount of pool laps. Track the individual time for each lap by tapping. 

Basic use cases: 
- Create player: Give name, maybe photo, and age. Users can be stored. 
- Create competition. Define a one-shoot competition by defining competition features as number of pool laps, for instance. Competition feature may change in the future. 
- Add player to competition. Adds an existing player to the competition. 
- Init Competition: Start a competition for the given members. 
- Start measuring player. 
- Add lap to running player. Show progress against the last lap (Best Time, for instance) 
- End competition for a player. Set competition to finished or not. Show progress.
